// -------------------------------------------------------------------
// The React demo: a form dialog built from a schema.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The point of this page is how little of it there is. overlays opens the dialog and owns
// the <form>; a zod schema owns everything about the fields; Mantine renders them. There
// is no field component here, no error state, no CSS and no aria wiring, because none of
// those are things a caller should have to write.
//
// # One model, read three ways
//
//   The zod object below is the only place a field is described. Three things read it:
//
//   - schemaResolver validates values against it and hands Mantine the messages;
//   - z.toJSONSchema() turns it into field metadata (which fields are mandatory, what each
//     is called, what kind of input the value wants), and Mantine's enhanceGetInputProps
//     feeds that to every input;
//   - the confirm button asks it for a verdict, through `validator`.
//
//   So a field is one line of JSX containing nothing but its path. Adding a field, making
//   one optional or renaming a label is a change to the model and to nothing else.
//
// # Native validation is off
//
//   `nativeValidation: false` puts `novalidate` on the library's <form>. The constraint
//   attributes stay where they are, so assistive technology still hears `required` and
//   phones still get the right keyboard from `type="email"`; only the browser's own
//   reporting steps aside. Without it a half-typed date raises a native bubble no matter
//   what attributes you leave off, and one kind of problem would have two presentations.
//
// # Validation and rejection are different things
//
//   `validator` is the client-side gate: it runs on a confirm click and returning false
//   keeps the dialog open. Everything after it is the retry loop below, where a confirm
//   is an attempt the "server" can reject - which also keeps the dialog open, with the
//   values intact, and shows a note instead of a field error.

// by default a dropdown or a calendar renders *behind* the dialog, and is inert with it.
//
// Pointing the portal at a node inside the dialog fixes both: the panel is then part of the
// dialog's subtree, so it inherits the top layer and stays interactive. `floatingStrategy`
// takes it out of flow so the dialog's own scrolling cannot clip it.
//
// The target has to come from inside the dialog, which is why this is a component and not a
