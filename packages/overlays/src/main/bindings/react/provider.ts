 * typed into it survives. Toast config is applied to the running stack immediately.

 * Functions compare equal regardless of identity, deliberately: an inline `getText`
 * arrow is new on every render and would otherwise re-open the loop. The cost is that a
 * changed `getText` alone reaches toasts already on screen only at their next render —
 * far cheaper than the alternative, and new toasts always read the current one.

/**

 *
 * - `createToastController` appends its stack to `<body>` right away, so building one in
 *   a render that React then throws away (StrictMode double-invokes every state
 *   initializer, exactly to surface this) would leak a container. Deferring to the first
 *   *call* means a discarded render pays nothing — it never runs an event handler.
 * - StrictMode also runs mount effects twice, setup → cleanup → setup. A cleanup that
 *   destroyed a controller nothing recreates would leave toasts dead in development;
 *   clearing the holder instead makes the next call build a fresh one.
