// Web Awesome's design tokens as an overlays theme — both halves, toasts and dialogs.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Nothing here is a copied colour. Web Awesome publishes its tokens as CSS custom
// properties, so every value below is a reference rather than a snapshot:
// change a token in the host app and these follow, including its light/dark switch, which
// Web Awesome does by rescoping the same tokens under .wa-light / .wa-dark. That is the
// whole reason this theme is worth having over a hand-matched palette.
//
// Naming follows --wa-color-{variant}-{fill|border|on}-{quiet|normal|loud}: `fill` is a
// background, `border` a stroke, and `on` the content that sits atop a fill. The three
// attention levels are how loud that pairing is. Fallbacks are the overlays defaults, so
// the theme degrades to the built-in look rather than to nothing if Web Awesome is absent.
//
// Reached as "@local/overlays/themes/webawesome".
