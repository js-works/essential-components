   * this is for a caller-owned validation library (Zod, Valibot, ...) that native HTML5
   * constraints can't express.
   *
   * With {@link FormDialogConfig.nativeValidation} set to `false` there is no native pass
   * to clear first, and this is the only verdict on the form.
   *
   * The library has no opinion on how invalid state is shown: the caller's own content
   * renders its own errors, and since content is rendered by your framework (not copied
   * in by the core), re-rendering that subtree is yours to do and safe at any time.
   *
   * It does have one on where to look next. When this turns a click down, focus moves to
   * the form's first control marked `aria-invalid="true"`, so the field that has to change
   * is ready to type in. That needs nothing from the validator: it is the attribute a
   * screen reader reads to announce a field as invalid, so a form layer that renders
   * accessible errors is already setting it.
   *
   * If nothing is marked invalid, `[autofocus]` is used instead - the same marker that
   * wins when the dialog opens - which lets a caller point at a field explicitly. With
   * neither, focus stays on the button that was clicked, which is what "press Enter to
   * retry" wants. Note that React's `autoFocus` prop does not produce that attribute: it
   * is applied by calling focus() on mount, so write `autofocus` literally for it to be
   * found.
   *
   * May return a promise - which is what schema libraries with async refinements and
   * form libraries like React Hook Form (whose `trigger()` is async) need. While one is
   * pending:
   *
   * - the clicked button shows its usual spinner, on the usual 150ms delay, because the
   *   click handler is simply still running;
   * - further clicks on validating buttons are dropped, so a second validation cannot
   *   start and a form dialog cannot queue a second attempt;
   * - Cancel, Escape and the close button stay live. A slow validator must not trap the
   *   user, so a verdict arriving after the dialog is gone is discarded.
   *
   * A rejected promise counts as invalid - the dialog stays open - and the error is
   * rethrown rather than swallowed, so a broken validator surfaces instead of looking
   * like a click that did nothing.
